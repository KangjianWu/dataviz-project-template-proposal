## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard that visualizes COVID-19 data across different countries. The goal was to elucidate relationships between countries in terms of COVID-19 impact using an integrative approach combining various types of visualizations like maps, bar charts, and line charts.


## Data Source
The dataset used for this visualization project is sourced from a publicly available GitHub gist, which includes COVID-19 cases and deaths data across multiple countries:

## Visualizations and Interactions

Key Features
 * World Map: An interactive map showing COVID-19 impact data, with countries colored differently based on their statistics to depict relative impact levels.
 * Bar Charts: Interactive bar charts appear when users hover over a country, displaying detailed statistics such as cases or deaths per million people.

Achieved Goals
 * Relationship Visualization: The world map uses color coding effectively to display the relationship between different countries' COVID-19 data.
 * Data Integration: Successfully combined multiple forms of visualization (map, bar charts, histograms) into a single, unified dashboard.
 * Selective Focus: Critical data points are highlighted, while less relevant data is minimized to maintain clarity and focus.

Interactive Elements
 * Enhanced user interaction through features like zooming and panning on the map.
 * Dynamic display of data through hover-over effects, allowing for deeper exploration of specific data points.


## Prototypes

Initial visualizations were developed to explore different facets of the COVID-19 data:


1. Top 10 countries by COVID-19 cases (Bar Chart)

## Conclusion
This project has effectively integrated complex COVID-19 data into an interactive dashboard, providing clear, engaging visualizations that help illustrate the global impact of the pandemic. The interactive features offer valuable insights into pandemic trends and differences across countries, demonstrating the power of data visualization in understanding global health issues.
