# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is https://gist.github.com/KangjianWu/db06675bba6753a66a7dcb861d37dbf7


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How to show the relationship between different countries on COVID-19 data through data visualization?
 * How to represent relationships between data in a visualization?
 * Which data need extra attention and which can be appropriately ignored?
 * How to integrate these different forms of visualization (bar charts, histograms and maps) into an interactive dashboard?

## Sketches
1.to show the relationship between different countries on COVID-19 data, the most efficient and intuitive way is to use a world map to show data between different countries.

2.to represent relationships between data, since the dataset does not have a point in time, I need to design a bar graph to show the number of cases or deaths per million people with COVID-19

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...


## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
