# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is https://gist.github.com/KangjianWu/db06675bba6753a66a7dcb861d37dbf7


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How to show the relationship between different countries on COVID-19 data through data visualization?
 * How to represent relationships between data in a visualization?
 * Which data need extra attention and which can be appropriately ignored?
 * How to integrate these different forms of visualization (bar charts, histograms and maps) into an interactive dashboard?

## Sketches
1.to show the relationship between different countries on COVID-19 data, the most efficient and intuitive way is to use a world map to show data between different countries.

2.to represent relationships between data, since the dataset does not have a point in time, I need to design a bar graph to show the number of cases or deaths per million people with COVID-19

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. 
1. It's a bar chart and it shows Top 10 countries by COVID-19 cases

2. It's a simple scatter plot and it shows Covid cases and deaths worldWide

3. It's a line chart and it shows COVID-19 total cases in the world's most populated countries

## Milestones

1. Finish a world map with some covid-19 data, make a simple draft.
